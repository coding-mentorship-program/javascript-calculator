 ## Example of functionality: 
  1. user presses 1 button
  2. user presses + button
  3. user presses 3 button 
  4. user presses = button 
  5. then result of 4 should display inside an input field
  
## Overview of logic: 
  1. When user presses the first number, we need to save that number in a variable
  2. Then user presses on an operator button like + or -, we need to save that operator in a variable
  3. Then user presses the second number we need to save that second number in a variable
  4. Then user presses the equal sign, then the first number needs to be calculated with the second number
  5. Then display the result in the display input value
